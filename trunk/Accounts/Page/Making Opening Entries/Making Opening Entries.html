<h2>How to make Opening Entries</h2>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> You are starting fresh in the system and you want to start your opening account balances and outstanding invoices in the system.</p>
<p>You know that when you start a new fiscal year, your accounts must be balanced, that is, Assets = Liabilities. But you also have Invoices that are yet to be realized and Bank Accounts that have balances.</p>
<h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>To start off, we create two temperory accounts "Opening Assets" and "Opening Liabilities". You can do that from your <a href="javascript:Chart_Accts();">Chart of Accounts</a>. You can create them wherever you like under your "Application of Funds" (Assets) and "Sources of Funds" (Liabilities) because when you are done with the process, they will become zero and you can trash them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create your outstanding <a href="javascript: newdoc('Receivable Voucher')">Sales Invoices</a> and <a href="javascript: newdoc('Payable Voucher')">Purchase Invoices</a>. Make these vouchers against the "Opening Asset" and "Opening Liablility" accounts, NOT against your "Sales" or "Expense" accounts.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff99;">Remember to set "Is Opening Entry" to "Yes" in the "Additional Info" tab.</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Update the Opening Balances of your other Accounts, create <a href="javascript: newdoc('Journal Voucher')">Journal Vouchers</a>. Again remember to set "Is Opening Entry" as "Yes". To balance your Journal Entries, debit / credit the accounts against your "Opening Assets" and "Opening Liabilities"</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you did your job well, then your Opening Assets will equal Open Liabilities, now you can make a Journal Voucher to make both these accounts to Zero, by crediting Opening Assets and debiting Opening Liabilities!</p>
