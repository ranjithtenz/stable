<h4>6. What is FIFO valuation and &ldquo;Moving Average&rdquo; valuation?</h4>
<p>a. FIFO (First in first out) - In case of FIFO, the items which came first will be sold first. The gross profit calculations will consider the purchase rate of items which were bought first. Stock value in this case would be the quantity of items multiplied by the rate at which they were bought.</p>
<p>b. Moving Average - In this case the moving average rate for an item will be calculated as :         [(Ra * Qa) + (Rb * Qb)]/(Qa + Qb)         where Ra is the incoming rate of the existing quantity Qa of the item and Rb is the incoming rate of the transaction quantity Qb.         Stock value will be the total quantity multiplied by the moving average rate.</p>
